GnuspeechSA (Stand-Alone)
=========================

GnuspeechSA is a command-line articulatory synthesizer that converts text
to speech.

GnuspeechSA is a C++ port of the TTS_Server in the original [Gnuspeech][]
system developed for NeXTSTEP, provided by David R. Hill, Leonard Manzara,
Craig Schock and contributors.
The base was the code on Gnuspeech's Subversion repository, revision 672,
downloaded in 2014-08-02. The source code was obtained from the directories:

    nextstep/trunk/ObjectiveC/Monet.realtime
    nextstep/trunk/src/SpeechObject/postMonet/server.monet

This software is part of Gnuspeech.

Usage of `gnuspeech_sa`
-----------------------

`gnuspeech_sa` converts the input text to speech.

    ./gnuspeech_sa [-v] -c config_dir -p trm_param_file.txt -o output_file.wav \
            "Hello world."
        Synthesizes text from the command line.
        -v : verbose

        config_dir is the directory that stores the configuration data,
            e.g. data/en.
        trm_param_file.txt will be generated, containing the tube model
            parameters.
        output_file.wav will be generated, containing the synthesized speech.

    ./gnuspeech_sa [-v] -c config_dir -i input_text.txt -p trm_param_file.txt \
            -o output_file.wav
        Synthesizes text from a file.
        -v : verbose

        config_dir is the directory that stores the configuration data,
            e.g. data/en.
        input_text.txt contains the input text.
        trm_param_file.txt will be generated, containing the tube model
            parameters.
        output_file.wav will be generated, containing the synthesized speech.

Usage of `gnuspeech_sa_trm`
---------------------------

`gnuspeech_sa_trm` executes only the tube model.

    ./gnuspeech_sa_trm [-v] trm_param_file.txt output_file.wav
        -v : verbose

        trm_param_file.txt is the file generated by gnuspeech_sa, containing the
            tube model parameters.
        output_file.wav will be generated, containing the synthesized speech.

Contents of data/en
-------------------

### `monet.xml`

Contains the articulatory database.

### `intonation`

Controls the intonation.

If `random_intonation = 0` in `trm_control_model.config`, only the first
line in each tone group will be used. If `random_intonation = 1`, the
line will be randomly selected.

### `MainDictionary`

Contains the main dictionary, which relates words to postures.

### `trm.config`

Contains the parameters for the tube model.

Interesting parameters are:

        vocal_tract_length_offset
            This value is added to the vocal tract length.
        loss_factor
            Defines the acoustic loss inside the vocal tract.

### `trm_control_model.config`

Contains the parameters for the tube model controller.

Interesting parameters are:

        voice_name
            Defines the voice used in the synthesis.
            It selects which of the voice_*.config files will be
            loaded.
        tempo
            Values greater than 1 will speed up the speech.
        pitch_offset
            Modifies the voice pitch.

        drift_deviation
        drift_lowpass_cutoff
            Control the random perturbations in the intonation
            (requires intonation_drift = 1).

        dictionary_1_file
        dictionary_2_file
        dictionary_3_file
            Indicate the dictionaries (the dictionaries will be
            searched in the order 1, 2, 3).

Note:

The following parameters are not being used at the moment:

- notional_pitch
- pretonic_range
- pretonic_lift
- tonic_range
- tonic_movement

### `voice_baby.config`

### `voice_female.config`

### `voice_large_child.config`

### `voice_male.config`

### `voice_small_child.config`

Contain the voice parameters.

Interesting parameters are:

        vocal_tract_length

        glottal_pulse_tp
            Rise time, in % of the period.
        glottal_pulse_tn_min
            Fall time, in % of the period - for the highest pulse
            amplitude.
        glottal_pulse_tn_max
            Fall time, in % of the period - for the lowest pulse
            amplitude.

            These parameters modify the glottal pulse shape.

        reference_glottal_pitch
            Modify the voice pitch.

        breathiness

### `vowelTransitions`

Controls vowel transitions.

### `vowelTransitions_2`

Alternative version of `vowelTransitions`.

It is not being used.
